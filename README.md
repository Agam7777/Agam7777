# 👋 Hi, I'm Agampreet Singh!  

I am passionate about **backend systems, NLP, Generative AI, and cloud computing**. I enjoy building scalable and efficient solutions, leveraging AI to solve real-world problems, and working with cloud technologies to optimize performance.  

Recently, I worked on **Resume Matcher & Enhancer**, a smart tool that analyzes resumes, matches them with job descriptions, and provides actionable improvement suggestions. It uses **NLP (spaCy)** for text processing, a **weighted similarity algorithm** for smart scoring, and offers **concrete feedback** to enhance resumes.
